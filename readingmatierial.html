Software Testing is a technique to determine if software is functioning correctly.
Testing has two goals:
1. finds defects (i.e., bugs)
2. builds confidence that the software works correctly
Why is finding bugs important? Software failure can cause:
1. Loss of money
2. Loss of reputation
3. Loss of life
4. maybe more???
All software has bugs. Bugs should be found in development, not when it is in the hands of the end-users. Good testing helps that happen.
Why is confidence in the software important? Lack of confidence in your product kills morale, which can kill the project.
Testing requires the following:
1. a set of items to be tested (e.g., functions, screens)
2. a known set of inputs for each item to test
3. the expected results for each item to test
4. the ability to execute each item with the necessary inputs and compare the actual result to the expected result
A test passes when the actual result is the same as the expected result (sometimes within a known tolerance). And a test fails when they are not.
There are different types of testing:
1. Unit testing: tests software "in the small", at the function-level. Unit tests are written by the programmers and accompany the software code
2. Integration testing: tests how software components work together (components are sometimes made by completely different teams)
3. System testing: tests software in an environment closer to how it will operate in production
4. Regression testing: testing software again when it changes to determine if the change broke something
Some interesting cases of insufficient testing:

How to test?
A very good question. There is no such thing as exhaustive testing (i.e., testing everything). Software is too complex for that.
In general, write tests that check:
1. the normal or valid path of execution (i.e., when all inputs are valid)
2. boundaries of inputs (really large values, really small values, null, empty strings)
3. all error checking paths (e.g., invalid file name, alphanumeric instead of numeric values)
How many tests to write?
A very good question. Very wise people say that a programmer should spend as much time writing tests, as he/she does writing code. Others say that half of the time spent developing software should be testing the software. As a starting point, try to write at least 5 tests per function parameter.
Test automation
Because testing is important and must be done frequently, the easier and faster it is for developers to execute the tests, the better.
Many types of tests these days use automated tools to make re-executing the tests easy (click a button or run a script) and consistent (no forgetting some of the tests). Unit tests these days tend to be automated, which makes executing the tests over and over again easy.
So, running the tests is no longer a problem in software development. However, coming up with enough good tests to find the important bugs is still a problem.
